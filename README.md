# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project applies a logistic regression model to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. It addresses the issue of class imbalance by downsampling the majority class (legitimate transactions) to match the number of fraudulent ones.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `creditcard.csv`, which contains credit card transactions labeled as:

- `0` — Legitimate transaction
- `1` — Fraudulent transaction

Each transaction includes anonymized numerical features (`V1` to `V28`), as well as `Time`, `Amount`, and the `Class` label.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Load and explore the dataset**
2. **Check class distribution** and separate legit and fraud transactions
3. **Downsample** the legitimate transactions to balance the dataset
4. **Split** the balanced data into training and testing sets
5. **Train** a logistic regression model
6. **Evaluate** model accuracy on both training and test data

---

## 📈 Results

- The model is trained and tested on a balanced dataset (equal number of fraud and legit cases).
- Accuracy is calculated on both training and test sets to evaluate performance.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
````

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `creditcard.csv` in the same directory.
2. Run the Python script (e.g., `fraud_detection.py`) or Jupyter notebook.

---

## ✅ Note

This is a **basic baseline model**. For production-level fraud detection, consider:

* Advanced models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost)
* Precision, recall, F1-score (not just accuracy)
* Handling imbalanced data with techniques like SMOTE
